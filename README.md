# Lab Task Python


### Project 1 - Calculator Project

      
#### Topics covered :
   Functions, Loops, Conditional Statements, User Input
   
#### Tools Needed :
Python 3.x

#### Duration : 
1.5 hours

#### Prerequisites :
Basic Python syntax, functions, and conditional statements.

#### Task :

Create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program should take user input and allow them to choose an operation, then output the result.
#### Steps :
Create functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

Use a loop to allow multiple operations until the user decides to exit.

Handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

Print the result after each operation.

### Project 2 - Number Guessing Game
#### Topics covered : 
Loops, Random Module, User Input, Conditional Statements

####Tools Needed: 
Python 3.x

####Duration: 
1-2 hours

####Prerequisites: 
Basic Python, random module, loops.

####Task:
Build a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the player guesses it.
The game should give feedback ("too high" or "too low") after each guess and count the number of attempts.

####Steps:
Use the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
Ask the player to input guesses and compare them to the generated number.
Give hints if the guess is too high or too low.
Track and display the number of attempts when the player guesses the correct number
